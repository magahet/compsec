Target 1: XSRF \
The vulnerable code is in account.php:24 \
because it displays the expected response, which can be used in the form submission. \


Target 2: XSS-password theft \
The vulnerable code is in index.php:29 \
because it sends unvalidated user input back to the client browser, which can be used to inject malicious code. \


Target 3: SQL Injection \
The vulnerable code is in auth.php:52 \
because it uses the non-escaped form of the username in the SQL query, which can be used to comment out the password checking component of the query. \
